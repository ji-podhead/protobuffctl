## Automate Your Protobuf Workflow
Protobuffctl is a comprehensive JavaScript API designed to streamline Protobuf development, offering features for creation, management, and automatic Protobuf generation, along with API server integration and a built-in dashboard for monitoring, testing and debugging.

## Key Features
- [Protobuffctl](https://github.com/ji-podhead/protobuffctl) offers an [API](https://ji-podhead.github.io/protobuffctl/) that enables you to automate all Protobuf functions.
- Manage `message types`, `fields`, `services`, `methods`, and `enums` by using **CLI commands** or the **API server**.
- **Automatically generates** the corresponding **Protobuf files** when making changes to the protofiles.
- Stores all components in the **local Componentregistry**.
- Sync with **other registries** like Gitey or PostgreSQL.
- **Rollback** by using a local safe-file or by using an external database, similar to **version control**.
- **Preview** the Protofile code before actually building it and export any component to **JSON**.
- Comes with a **Dashboard** for demo, debugging, and **testing**.
- **Monitoring** for individual `message types` and `services` using the dashboard and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
- The middleware ensures **ACID** compliance and **prevents race conditions**

##                      Comming up
- Set up **File Watcher** to monitor your proto files for any changes. üöß 
- create **VC CODE EXTENSION** to manage the api in vs code  üöß  
- sync with **external DB** üöß 
- finish  **Dashboard**  and use a web compiler for demo üöß
- implement UUID hashing logic 
- add **tests** to Dashboard and a gRPC debug-Server üöß
